A quick solution that could drastically accelerate the performance of your application

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4201/`.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `nx g component component-name` to generate a new component. [Learn More](https://nx.dev/latest/angular/cli/generate)

You can also use `nx g directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/apps/` directory.

Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running with production mode

Run `npm run start:prod-local` to run the project. You need to have [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) installed globally

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
